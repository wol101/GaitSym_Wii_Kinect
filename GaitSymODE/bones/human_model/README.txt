These models have been scaled and converted to OBJ files
based on the outlines found on the ISB web site and 
attributed to Delp as used in Sellers et al 2003, 2004, 2005.

They are designed for use with the Winter recommended formulae
for inertial parameters. They are scaled so that they are unit sized
from the standard end points:

                                                Relative segment mass   Centre of mass          Radius of Gyration/segment length 
                                                                        (proximal to distal)   (about proximal joint except HAT)
HAT greater trochanter to glenohumeral joint    0.6780                  0.6260                  0.7980
Thigh                                           0.1000                  0.4330                  0.5400
Leg (calf)                                      0.0465                  0.4330                  0.5280
Foot (lat maleolus to head of metatarsal 2)     0.0145                  0.5000                  0.6900

The origin of the outlines is the centre of mass. 
Positive x is caudal and distal.
Positive z is ventral.
Positive y is left.
